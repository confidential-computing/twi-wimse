1.  Introduction

   Until recently, there were few scenarios requiring data-in-use
   protection.  This is starting to change.  Regulatory bodies worldwide
   are increasingly requiring data-in-use protection and privacy
   enhancing technologies.  Outside of regulatory requirements,
   companies are exploring:

   *  Multiparty computation

   *  Machine learning training & inferencing

   *  Addressing the risks of computing in public clouds and high-risk
      locations

   *  Entrusting confidential data to SaaS providers

   *  Insider threats, and other reasons for protecting data-in-use

   Correspondingly, there is an increased push to harmonize management
   and governance of human and non-human identities.  Modern workloads
   may operate on their own behalf with their own credentials, or as
   agents on behalf of other entities with delegated credentials.
   Entities interested in strong assurances around the security of their
   deployed workloads, for regulatory, contractual or peace of mind
   reasons, are facing large and challenging tasks of upgrading their
   existing computing system infrastructure to meet these requirements.
   Current ways of issuing and managing workload identities, as well as
   those required for effective protection of data-in-use, are subject
   to multiple architectural challenges; chief among them:

   1.  Lack of workload isolation against the hardware and the operating
       system owners/administrators, as well as peer workload instances

   2.  Lack of strong binding between a workload credential and the
       workload instance to which that credential had been issued

   3.  Lack of verifiable composition of the workload, and inability to
       associate a credential with a set of decisions leading up to its
       issuance

   It is important to highlight that these shortcomings are related:
   lack of process isolation eases credential exfiltration and leads to
   credential leakage and reuse.

   Confidential Computing can close these architectural gaps due to its
   unique features (i.e., verifiable composition, strong workload
   isolation) and broad availability (i.e., support by all major
   hardware vendors).  Multiple emerging regulations will mean that
   customers will be looking to these features and capabilities to
   satisfy them.

   Confidential Computing-assisted mechanisms have to align with the
   emerging Workload Identity solution ecosystem.  Correspondingly, the
   evolution of the Workload Identity ecosystem should remain in
   alignment with the expectations of the owners and operators of
   Confidential Computing workloads.  To address this set of
   requirements, this document defines and elaborates on the concept of
   Trustworthy Workload Identity (TWI) in the following Sections.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses terms and concepts defined by the WIMSE and RATS
   architectures, as well as the terms defined by the Trustworthy
   Workload Identity Special Interest Group at the Confidential
   Computing Consortium.  For a complete glossary, see Section 4 of
   [RFC9334] , [I-D.draft-ietf-wimse-arch] & [TWISIGCharter].

   The definitions of terms like Workload Identity, Workload Credential
   and Workload Provenance match those specified by the TWI SIG Charter
   [TWISIGCharter].

   Workload:  [I-D.draft-ietf-wimse-arch] defines 'Workload' as "an
      instance of software executing for a specific purpose".  Here we
      restrict that definition to the portions of the deployed software
      and its configuration that are subject to Remote Attestation.

   Workload Identifier:  a stable construct around which Relying Parties
      can form long-lived Workload authorization policies.

   Workload Identity:  the definition of Workload Identity is identical
      to the definition of the same term by [I-D.draft-ietf-wimse-arch]:
      "a combination of three basic building blocks: trust domain,
      Workload Identifier and identity credentials.

   Workload Credential:  an ephemeral identity document containing the
      Workload Identifier and a number of additional claims, that can be
      short-lived or long-lived, and that is used to represent and prove
      Workload Identity to a Relying Party.

   Workload Provenance:  a unique linkage between a Workload Credential
      and the trusted entities (such as a vendor, developer, or issuer)
      responsible for the production and/or the remote attestation of
      the corresponding Workload.

3.  Gap Analysis

   The following shortcomings were identified by performing a gap
   analysis of the current WIMSE architecture
   [I-D.draft-ietf-wimse-arch] against the requirements underlying
   Trustworthy Workload Identity (TWI).  The gap analysis provides the
   basis for identifying extensions necessary to meet the level of
   trustworthiness required by Confidential Computing environments.

   *  Protection of Credentials at runtime and insufficient Runtime
      Attestation:

      -  Without data-in-use protection, there is always a risk that
         Credentials in memory could be exposed if a Workloadâ€™s
         execution environment is compromised.

      -  Confidential Computing does not trust its hosting environment
         and relies on each Workload attesting itself.

   *  Token replay and misuse:

      -  Token binding, even if used, is not sufficient unless the
         secrets underpinning the Workload Credentials are protected
         from leakage.

   *  Lack of verifiable workload composition accessible through
      Credential Provenance:

      -  When a Relying Party receives a Credential, or when an auditor
         examines a log of decisions by a Relying Party, it is unable to
         peform additional checks on the security properties of the
         Workload or the process involved in creating it, beyond the
         claims communicated inside the Credential.

4.  Alignment or Synergy with WIMSE Architecture

   WIMSE defines an architecture for managing Workload Identity in
   multi-system environments.

   1.  The WIMSE Architecture explains the core concept of Workload
       Identity in-line with the concept of identity in the TWI world.

   2.  WIMSE model has a CA/Credential issuer that is responsible for
       provisioning identity Credentials to the Workload.  TWI
       requirement is roughly similar in terms of issuing credentials.
       However, the requirements and policies applied when issuing
       Credentials vary as described in the Extensions section below.

   3.  WIMSE Architecture defines Trust Domain, which is the authority
       that identifies domain within which the identifier is scoped.
       TWI Architecture is aligned with this basic building block.

5.  Extensions to the WIMSE Architecture

   Trustworthy Workload Identity as detailed in this document proposes
   the following extensions and changes to the core WIMSE Architecture.

5.1.  Workload Isolation and the Role of the Hosting Environment

   Under Confidential Computing, the confidentiality and integrity of a
   Workload is isolated from the hosting environment and other
   Workloads.  The underlying assumption in the WIMSE architecture that
   the hosting environment can be fully trusted to establish the
   identity of a hosted Workload is incompatible with the assumptions of
   Confidential Computing.  Confidential Workloads perform their own
   Remote Attestation and Workload isolation ensures that the hosting
   environment cannot interfere with this process.

5.2.  Remote Attestation

   Under Confidential Computing, Remote Attestation plays a fundamental
   role in assessing the trustworthiness of the Workload and ensuring
   that the Workload is running on a platform that provides required
   security guarantees.

5.2.1.  Integrating Workload Attestation with Credential Issuance

   The Credential Issuer would process the Attestation Results from the
   Verifier and apply its own Appraisal Policy for Attestation results
   prior to issuing Credentials.

5.2.2.  Remote Attestation of Composite Workloads

   Confidential Workloads may be "Composite", i.e., span Trusted
   Execution Environments yet share a Workload Credential.  The details
   are to be defined at a later time.

5.3.  Provenance

   Existing fields inside X.509 certificates (e.g., a certificate serial
   number) or Workload Identity Tokens (e.g., the "jti" claim) can be
   used to uniquely tie the Workload Credential to the chain of events
   leading up to its issuance; as a result, no change is necessary.

5.3.1.  Workload Provenance

   Workload Provenance can be interrogated to receive the metadata
   pertaining to Workload, as follows:

   1.  Workload Composition, i.e. a detailed list of components that
       comprise a Workload.  This could be expressed as a Software Bill
       of Materials expressed in terms of industry standards, like SPDX
       or CycloneDX <TODO: add references?>.

   2.  Set of Compliance tests that executed on the Workload.

   3.  Details of Vendor/SaaS information.

   The policy for issuing Credentials may demand the information about
   the Provenance of the Workload.  This requries work in two areas (a)
   Obtaining the Provenance information about the Workload AND (b)
   Conveying the provenance information inside the Credential.

5.3.1.1.  Obtaining Workload Provenance

   The Workload Provenance can be made available in a transparent
   manner, which can be audited and verified by independent parties.
   While it is a policy of the implementation as to how it obtains the
   Provenance information, the trustworthiness aspect associated with
   Provenance information can be verified during the runtime
   trustworthiness assessment of a Workload, through the means of Remote
   Attestation, at the time of Workload acquiring the Credentials from
   credential issuer.

5.3.1.2.  Integrating Workload Provenance with Credential Issuance

   The Provenance information can be attached to the Workload
   credentials using a well-defined protocol.

5.3.2.  Credential Provenance

   Credential Provenance is the metadata pertaining to the Credential
   issuance itself, binding the:

   *  Workload (including Workload Provenance (Section 5.3.1))

   *  Verifier (as defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC9334]), including the
      criteria it applied to the attestation evidence

   *  Credential Issuer (including its issuance policies effective at
      the time)

   While the Workload Identity remains stable for as long as the
   Workload properties remain unchanged, a unique Credential Provenance
   MUST be generated each time a Workload Credential is issued.

   Creation of a Credential Provenance record SHOULD additionally be
   recorded in a transparency log (if in use by the solution), to
   provide discoverability, immutability and non-repudiation by the
   issuer.  The transparency log record MAY be encrypted to prevent
   disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or buisness-
   critical data.

5.4.  Workload to Platform binding

   TODO: Issue #27 filed.

6.  Integration of Confidential Computing into WIMSE

6.1.  Secure Key Storage & Cryptographic Operations

   With TEEs, a Workloadâ€™s private keys and sensitive cryptographic
   operations (such as signing or validating tokens) can be isolated
   from the hosting environment, reducing the risk of key leakage even
   if the hosting environment is compromised.  (For instance, the WIMSE
   token â€” be it a JWT or an X.509 certificate â€” can be generated and
   signed within a TEE, ensuring that the proof-of-possession mechanism
   remains intact.)

6.2.  Enhanced Bootstrapping with Attestation

   Strengthening the initial bootstrapping process.  A TEE can enable
   hardware-based Remote Attestation, proving that a Workload is running
   in a secure, isolated environment.  This attestation could be used as
   an additional factor during Workload Credential provisioning,
   ensuring that only Workloads running in a TEE and matching the
   Workload Credential issuer's attestation policies receive valid
   credentials.

6.3.  Protected Credential Exchange

   For the Credential exchange patterns defined in the WIMSE Credential
   Exchange draft, Confidential Computing can provide a Trusted
   Execution Environment in which the exchange logic runs.  This ensures
   that the process of exchanging or re-provisioning credentials is
   protected against tampering and eavesdropping.

6.4.  Mitigating Runtime Compromise

   Executing the Workload inside a Trusted Execution Environment can
   lower the risk that runtime attacks (such as memory scraping or side-
   channel attacks) can expose critical identity or authentication
   tokens.  For example, a Trusted Execution Environment can be used to
   securely generate and verify proofs of possession that are important
   within the WIMSE authentication protocol.
