            Trusted Workload Identity Reference Architecture
                draft-twi-reference-architecture-latest

Abstract

   Technological advancement coupled with security concerns demands more
   and more use cases, that require data-in-use protections.  In
   addition, regulatory bodies around the world increasingly require
   data-in-use protection and privacy enhancing technologies.  As these
   advanced technologies are being deployed, challenge remains how to
   identify the workloads and put trust behind them?  This draft will
   address the core issue of managing a trustworthy workload identity
   meeting Confidential Computing requirements.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses terms and concepts defined by the WIMSE and RATS
   architecture.  For a complete glossary, see Section 4 of [RFC9334] &
   [I-D.draft-ietf-wimse-arch].

3.  Glossary

   This document uses the following terms:

3.1.  Workload Identity

3.2.  Workload Credential

4.  TWI Use Cases

   Following are some of the use cases demanding trustworthy workload
   identity.

   1.  A ML Model Owner (acting as Relying Party) wants to deploy its
       Workload with a unique identity in a privacy preserving manner.
       It needs to ensure that the deployed workload is operating in an
       environment with certain security guarantees, such as isolated
       from cloud hosting environment and can be periodically attested.

   2.  A Workload operating as a deployed lambda running in an isolated
       environment.

5.  Core Requirements

   The TWI Core Requirements can be located here.  (TO DO Add link here
   from Mark)

6.  Alignment or Synergy with WIMSE Architecture

7.  Divergence from WIMSE

   Trustworthy Workload Identity as detailed in this document has
   following fundamental divergence from core WIMSE Architecture.

7.1.  Workload Confidentiality

7.2.  Workload Provenance

7.2.1.  Integrating Workload Provenance with Credential Issuance

   ## Workload to Platform binding

7.3.  Workload Attestation

7.3.1.  Integrating Workload Attestation with Credential Issuance

7.3.2.  Remote Attestation of Composite Workloads

8.  TWI Reference Architecture

   This sections describes in detail, the Reference Architecture for
   Trusted Workload Identity system

8.2.  Roles in the TWI Eco-System

   The following sub-sections describe the various roles or building
   blocks that exist in the TWI eco-system.

8.2.1.  Verifier

8.2.2.  Identity Provider

8.2.3.  Credential Issuer
